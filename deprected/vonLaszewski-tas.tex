\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

In this paper we presented a framework that does publication and citation data retrieval, scientific impact metrics generation on different aggregated levels, as well as correlation analysis of the impact metrics vs the resource allocation for a computing facility. We applied the framework to conduct scientific impact metrics evaluation of XSEDE, and did extensive statistical analysis on the impact metrics on project level and Field of Science (FOS) level correlating to the Service Units (SUs) allocated by XSEDE. This not only shows the impact of the XSEDE in general, but also details how the impact is reflected on project level and different FOS. Some of the work could be utilized by XSEDE resource allocation review to help achieve higher scientific impact of XSEDE and better return of investment in general.
